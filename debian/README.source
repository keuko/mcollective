MCollective source for Debian
-----------------------------

This source is created by pre-stripping the embedded systemu library from the
upstream tarball. The Debian package of mcollective depends on ruby-systemu
Debian packages.

Also ext/activemq/wlcg-patch.tgz and ext/activemq/apache-activemq.spec was
removed from Debian source tarball. It contains stuff from the ActiveMQ
upstream package.
